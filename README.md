# hello-world
I am developing a horror games on a yound woman who finds herself lost in an abandoned mission and must fight her own memories to survive.
My name is Becky and I am a 3 year old mother of 3. I have always wanted to create my very own horror game. This game is going to be my very first and I am very excited.
